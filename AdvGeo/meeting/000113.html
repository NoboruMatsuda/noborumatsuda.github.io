In our discussion, ...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
"<b>diagram</b>" (in Marsha's paper) is a topological structure of a theorem
to prove.&nbsp; This also refers to a composition of specific configurations
(as opposed to an abstract configuration described below).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
"<b>configuration</b>" (in our paper) is a topological structure of an
axiom used to prove theorems.&nbsp; This refers to an abstract entity (e.g.,
one can imagine an arbitrary triangle for the isosceles-triangle axiom).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Behavioral change though learning in geometry&nbsp; (abstract -> specific
-> abstract)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<ol>
<li>
Students begin to learn geometry with axioms, which are described with
configurations (i.e., in an abstracted form).<br>
&nbsp;.</li>

<li>
To learn how to use axioms (i.e., problem-solving strategy), they need
to be fed bunch of problems.&nbsp; In other words, they must struggle with
specific diagrams for a while.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In this stage, diagram might be a basis of students' memory of proof. (Marsha
et al. 1994)&nbsp; They tend to use previous experience.<br>
<br>
However, since learned axioms are not abstracted enough, they suffer from
the retroactive interference effects; solving two problems with the same
diagram but different logic cause a difficulty to solve the third problem.<br>
&nbsp;.</li>

<li>
Eventually, they become not to rely on the diagrams in their past experience,
but to be able to retrieve axioms from their memory. (Koedinger et al.
1990)</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
So, both diagram and configuration play a central role in learning geometry.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
To see if the above hypothesis is true, we can test experts in geometry
with the same paradigm as the one in Marsha's work; since they have fairly
abstracted axioms, they should not suffer from the retroactive interference
effects.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Design issues ...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Clicking an icon for forward chaining might confuse students, because several
axioms are applied at the same time.&nbsp; They do not think all the applicable
axioms at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Students might want to know how a particular fact (in the facts list) is
deduced.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Lining up the icons for forward chaining and construction, and backward
chaining at the same place might confuse students, because the former stand
for set of axioms, while the latter represents an axiom.&nbsp; They might
reason in terms of axiom.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Experiment issues ...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Conduct experiments with and without DS icons to see how the reification
with DS icons works.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
If you compare our GUI with ANGLE (Koedinger et al.), you have to be aware
of following factors on learning effects.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
solution tree vs search tree</li>

<li>
displaying a whole tree vs 1-by-1 presentation</li>

<li>
DC model vs GRAMY (a model of problem solving)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
