<p>We have finalized new GRAMY search algorithm</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="GRAMY-new-search.pdf">GRAMY-new-search</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A basic idea for the next experiment</p>
<ul>
  <li>The search with brute-force construction might work for a simple
    problem.&nbsp; In that case, the searches with brute-force construction and
    the general construction must produce exactly the same set of proofs.</li>
  <li>The search with general construction might work for more difficult
    problems as well, but it might fail on &quot;regular&quot; problems such
    that the ones we saw in the literature.</li>
  <li>For the problems that beyond the general construction, we need to modify
    the construction technique so that the conditions for construction are
    embedded into DS matching (like current GRAMY's construction
    operator).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons learned</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once we built an AI system, we need to think if what we got is really what
    we need.&nbsp; To see that we must appreciate the &quot;knowledge&quot;
    implemented in the system.&nbsp; In the present study, it is the heuristics
    for construction that we should realize the value.&nbsp; If you can't see
    their value (which is usually the case), losing them makes you become
    conscious of their true value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
