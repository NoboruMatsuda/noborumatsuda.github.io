<h3><font color="#000080">Starting point</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We haven't known the relationship between general construction and old
  GRAMY's specialized construction.</p>
  <p>Wish to know it, because that would convince us the completeness of GRAMY
  as well as an educational value of GRAMY.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">General construction is ...</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>just like a hill climbing algorithm; they never know when an operation
  application improves the partial match.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>This kind of problem is also called a telephone pole problem for the
  telephone poles on the flat ground are similar to the peaks of the
  problem-solving performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">Lessons learned:</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We would be able to prove that GRAMY's construction procedure is complete
  wrt DSs.</p>
  <p>If GRAMY is complete, then we would end up with having a cognitive model
  for effective construction.</p>
  <p>There is no efficient algorithms with general construction exists --
  pruning inappropriate constructions is not the key issue to make construction
  tractable.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The key issue is the &quot;<font color="#FF0000">revised GRAMY's
  specialized procedure</font>,&quot; which says &quot;for each partial match
  try to see if there exists a sequence of general construction operators to
  copy the DS configuration onto the problem figure.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">Proof on the completeness of GRAMY</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>for each DS</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>for each goal</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>for each partial match</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>for each sequence of primitive construction operator that copies the
        DS configuration onto the problem figure that makes the DS have a
        perfect match</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>there exists an output from GRAMY that has the same perfect match</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">Cognitive task analysis of GRAMY</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>If we can prove the completeness of GRAMY just mentioned above, then we
  would be able to argue that GRAMY's construction procedure is what the
  students have to learn, which is the key for masterly learning.</p>
  <p>The basic idea is that &quot;pick up a useful DS and copy the configuration
  onto the problem figure.&quot;</p>
  <p>The model of construction in GRAMY drops most of the operations my compass
  and straightedge.&nbsp; The students still have to notice that they are using
  compass and straightedge when they draw lines with certain constraints.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">Next step</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Prove that the revised GRAMY's specialized construction procedure actually
  works for a few DSs and a few partial matches.</p>
  <p>We would be happy to find a pattern of those proofs.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#000080">A step in a future toward an ITS</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We do need heuristics of construction for GRAMY's construction procedure
  still produced too many constructions for students to deal with.&nbsp; </p>
