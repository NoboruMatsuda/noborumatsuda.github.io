      with the same set of points but differ in the segments connecting them
      would be considered as identical.&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Constructions&quot; with the same configuration could be treated as
    either the <i>same</i> or the <i>different</i> constructions depending on
    the order of points (hence segments) constructed.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#000080">Definition vs. Assertion</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To construct a new segment or a new point point is to define new object,
    which is assessed as well-defined or not (they can't be wrong or
    correct).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A proof is composed by a set of assertions inputted, which you can tell
    true or false.</p>

  <p><u><font color="#000080">Relevancy of a statement</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is actually an interesting research questions that &quot;do you need
    to allow students to go down a garden path?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>They would certainly learn something from an impasse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><font color="#000080">Educational objectives</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We could teach students geometric concepts, which the teachers claim what
    they mainly do.</p>
    <p>We could teach students problem solving (i.e., search) skills for
    geometry proof, which is what the teachers actually do.&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><u><font color="#000080">Local heuristics vs. abstract plans</font></u></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>To teach problem solving skills (i.e., search), you can either provide
    students with (1) the local heuristics that tells you which operator to take
    in what situation, or (2) the abstract plans that tells you how to assemble
    a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Andes-III is intended to provide abstract planning for students to
    learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Remember the <i>capillary graph</i> that represent a planning space in
    the top half and an instantiations of the plan in the bottom half.&nbsp;</p>
