<h3><font color="#008080">Things we need to investigate</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Teaching proof writing as cognitive skills would fail, or less interesting.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>c.f. Waff &amp; Proof</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Instead, <i>investigating a relationship between proof writing and rest of
  mathematics</i> would be more interesting.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>We would teach students &quot;what is proof for&quot; instead of
    &quot;what is proof.&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#008080">Some researches on proof that don't focus on symbolic manipulation
as cognitive skills</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/hp/Tarski1.html">Tarski's world</a>
  (Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy)</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>3D geometry quiz asking a relation between logical statements and a
    model.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Proof and refutations (Imre Lakatos)</p>
  <p>Proof as explanations</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#008080">Things to do next</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>See if the model tracing tutors (the Geometry Tutor and ANGLE) have
  answered one of these questions:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Can ITS teach students that proof is a chain of postulates from givens to
    a goal?</p>
    <p>Can ITS teach students how to control their search?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If they didn't answer those questions, then that's what we would
  investigate.</p>
  <p>Basically, I need to know (1) what does it mean to teach proof writing
  other than as cognitive skills and (2) if the model tracing tutors have
  addressed (or could achieve) these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
