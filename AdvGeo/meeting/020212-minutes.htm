<h3><font color="#008080">Need to have my own theory in mind:</font> </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Then, go through the literature again to find supports and dis-supports </p>
  <p>The theory-in-mind (i.e., our hypothesis on teaching/learning proof
  writing) must be valid in a sense they can be well operationalized.
  </p>
  <p>We have GRAMY that is a sufficient and efficient model of theorem
  proving.&nbsp;
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Having GRAMY in mind would helps to build up a theory-in-mind. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From the literature survey, we would likely argue that proof-writing skill
  consists of the following factors:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>+ definition of objects</p>
    <p>+ postulates</p>
    <p>+ parsing or matching diagram</p>
    <p>+ search control / search strategy</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>- proof structure</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p>and the question is how are they related each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>conjunctive: they are all related in a complex manner.</p>
    <p>stepwise: they can be acquired one by one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">What's DFA for? </font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>For designing effective instructions.</p>
  <p>For learning more about human learning.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Investigating a bunch of difficulties and observing how students would
    overcome those issues would end up with knowing more about how human
    learn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, we might see either implicit or explicit learning is good to
    learn search strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>DFA would also lead us to an assessment issue:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>What should be assessed and how.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>

<h3><font color="#008080">The correlation between VHL and proof writing:</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>1.&nbsp; VHL and proof writing measured at the same time.</p>
  <p>2.&nbsp; VHL as a predictor of proof writing --&nbsp; VHL at the beginning
  of a school year and proof-writing ability at the end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>See even if the students with high VHL would have low proof-writing
  abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">Need to clarify the students' difficulty in
&quot;language&quot;?&nbsp; </font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>How does it differ from &quot;basic factors,&quot; which are described in
  the language?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">Reliability and validity of a study:</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Be careful in the conclusions literature.&nbsp; Even if they have data,
  different researchers might have different interpretations.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><font color="#008080">Showing result is not enough:</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We need a theory that explains a result.&nbsp; </p>
