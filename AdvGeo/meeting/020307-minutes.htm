  <blockquote>
    <p>Floundering represents student's irrelevant, erroneous, frustrated 
    actions that must be got rid of.&nbsp; The student might make an error, 
    which in turn trap the student in an impasse.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Exploring represents student's efforts to achieve a goal.&nbsp; Must be 
    encouraged (true?).&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The protocol data on Geometry show evidence that students need to 
    explore. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>They are not following a certain solution path, which is expected by 
      most MMT.&nbsp; </p>

    <p>A lesson learning from Andes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Students do flounder a lot even when they get enormous amount of help.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Why?&nbsp; Nobody knows...</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The students might not know backward chaining, hence a global help 
          doesn't make much sense to them.</p>
          <p>The students might not know domain principles. </p>

  <p><font color="#008080"><b>What they have learned from Andes:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Old Andes</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Huge amount of protocol with Ss actions synchronized with their 
      utterance.</p>
      <p>Most students floundered a lot and very frustrated.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Snapshot critique</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Confirmed a need both for local and global help.</p>
      <p>Local help:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Along with the student's solution path, give a immediate feedback to 
        put the student back onto right track.&nbsp; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Global help:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>When got stuck, give a top down (backward chaining) help to start 
        over the solution. </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Andes II</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Implemented a global help provided when student ask &quot;what's next.&quot;</p>
      <p>Ss actually ask &quot;what's next&quot; help a lot, but they still floundered.&nbsp;

  <p><font color="#008080"><b>A challenging problem:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How to maximize student's exploration while 
    minimizing their floundering.</b></font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>So, the research question might be about student's initiative in 
    exploratory learning.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Andes is indeed a version of exploratory model tracer!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We would compare different initiative control strategies to figure out 
    how to control student vs. tutor initiative to obtain maximum learning gain.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Prospective control conditions:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>(1) wide open:&nbsp; no tutoring system at all.&nbsp; Ss work with 
        paper and pencil.&nbsp; Maximum exploration, maximum floundering.</p>
        <p>(2) Scaffolding:&nbsp; provide as much scaffolding as possible to 
        prevent students from floundering.&nbsp; Minimum exploration, minimum 
        floundering.&nbsp; </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Possible threat:&nbsp; pacing.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If you let students go through with very slow speed, then they would 
        learn things well anyway.&nbsp; Slow pacing would wiped out the truth.&nbsp;
        </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#008080"><b>Stop floundering:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Andes III is supposed to struggle with the floundering by (1) reifying 
    the whole problem solving process, (2) cutting down memory load, and (3) 
    providing well organized curriculum.&nbsp; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font color="#008080"><b>Next step:</b></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left">Finish up the data analysis.&nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left">Make a comparison between exploration and floundering.</p>
      <p align="left">Hopefully, well formalized so that a machine can 
      determine, from activity log, if a student is exploring or floundering.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>Visualization of student's reasoning steps would be a plus. </p>

      <p>&quot;learner control&quot; from CAI literature; might be messy, though...</p>
