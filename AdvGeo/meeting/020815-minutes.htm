<h3><font color="#008080">Forward hinting vs. backward hinting</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>when a student assert a proposition that is not justified, it might be 
  reasonable to provide a hint on that unjustified assertion.&nbsp; (backward 
  hinting)</p>
  <p>when a student complete a part of proof (i.e., assert everything in a 
  sub-tree) and got stuck, the tutor could either provide a hint on what is 
  derived from the sub-tree just completed (forward hinting) or provide a hint 
  on top most goal by tabling the sub-tree (backward hinting).</p>
  <p>Try to find both patter in the protocol data</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><font color="#008080">Need to clarify some terminologies</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>assertion vs. supposition</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A student could &quot;assert&quot; a proposition with a confident</p>
    <p>A student could &quot;suppose&quot; a proposition with a hope</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>goal recognition vs. plan recognition</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Within a single solution, the tutor must select a &quot;goal&quot; to work on next</p>
    <p>Within a solution space, the tutor must select a &quot;plan&quot; (or a solution if 
    you will) to work on.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The plan recognition may not matter, since a non-successful student 
      doesn't have a plan at all.</p>
    </blockquote>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><font color="#008080">We are going to ...</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>establish a new paradigm on hinting that is somewhat in between MTT and CBT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">Thesis</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>H-GOMS is better than MMT or a tutor with random hinting</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Might be the first thesis on a theory of hinting that investigates an 
    effectiveness of  hint with respect to the target step, form of hint, 
    and a focus of hint.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>cf feedback on LISP tutor by Jean McKendree </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>(a thesis that says &quot;Human tutors utilize H-GOMS&quot; could be an interesting thesis, but we're 
  not gonna take it)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">Experiment</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We need a comparative experiment</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>better to use the psych subject pool</p>
    <p>the participants need to take geometry course</p>
    <p>need to provide a refresh course so that the participants would get back 
    what they learned</p>
    <p>design one control condition (either MTT or CBT)</p>
    <p>need to think about a problem set:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>doesn't involve so many axioms</p>
      <p>must have short proofs</p>
      <p>must involve simple constructions</p>
      <p>must have not so many alternative proofs</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Can build an ITS just for the experiment, not a practical one.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><font color="#008080">Time schedule</font></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Get the experiment done by the end of fall 2002</p>
  <p>Write up a short (conference) paper in Jan, 2003 with a result from the 1st 
  experiment</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>1. shape up the hinting patters extracted from data including other problems (in 2 
  weeks)</p>
  <p>2. look for a theoretical motivation for H-GOMS, namely, think about what 
  makes H-GOMS works fine.</p>
  <p>3. based on the theoretical support from the step #2, design an experiment:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>we need a statistic (gain score)</p>
    <p>we also need extra data for the case that the statistics won't show a 
    significant result.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4. if we gain a big effect, then we are ready to write thesis.</p>
  <p>5. if we won't find an expected result, then ... we'll think a backup plan 
  at that time.</p>
