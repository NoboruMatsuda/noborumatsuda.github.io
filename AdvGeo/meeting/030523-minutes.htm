  <blockquote>
    <p>There are two different degree of scaffolding that is the subject of 
    fading:&nbsp; the degree of grain size of problem-solving step, and the 
    degree of abstractness of the message provided</p>
    <p>Wadein (by Peter) might be a good example of fading scaffolding</p>
    <p>When providing scaffolding with finer grain size (i.e., providing 
    scaffolding on deeper steps), the tutor must mention a higher step.&nbsp; 
    Remember Catramborn's study on articulation of a goal structure.</p>
    <p>How do you handle backup?&nbsp; </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The tutor might want to provide only the on-the-path hints.&nbsp; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Need to provide a &quot;rational&quot; hints by adapting the grain size of 
    scaffolding.&nbsp; This is done by assigning the tutor's estimation on a 
    probability for the student having understood the corresponding 
    problem-solving step.&nbsp; How to maintain such estimation is quite 
    questionable, though.&nbsp; </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Is learning this detailed procedure better off for the students learning 
    theorem proving?</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Do the experiment group show better transfer?</p>
      <p>Do the experiment group require less learning time?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Is the tutor (with this thorough scaffolding) acceptable for students?&nbsp; 
    (Screaming test)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Is the dialogue natural for students?</p>
      <p>* Provide students with a control over the amount of scaffolding they'd 
      get.&nbsp; They can tell the tutor not to bother them by providing too 
      much scaffolding.&nbsp; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Use Andes tutor (not model tracing tutor) as a control condition</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Provide hints on forward chaining only</p>
