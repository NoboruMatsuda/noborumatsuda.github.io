    <p><span lang="ja">Although AGT provides tutor's explanations, we do not 
    compare it with student's self-explanation.&nbsp; So, the claim in &quot;Impact 
    of proactive scaffolding&quot; that says &quot;we will see if learning is equally 
    effective when students' self-explanation is replaced with tutor's 
    self-explanation.&nbsp; </span></p>

    <p><span lang="ja">It's just providing instruction on problem solving.&nbsp; 
    Why use new term?</span></p>
    <p><span lang="ja">Scaffolding shouldn't just a direct instruction.&nbsp; It 
    must be something that help students to do their job.&nbsp; Like scaffolding 
    helps constructors to build up a building.&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p><span lang="ja">The tutor does fade in and out scaffolding hence it is 
    not just another type of instruction given.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="ja">The tutor does help students to <i>learn</i> cognitive 
    skills through problem solving.&nbsp; Solving problem is a mean to achieve 
    mastery in specific cognitive skills, not a goal, hence the tutor does 
    provide scaffolding.</span></p>
