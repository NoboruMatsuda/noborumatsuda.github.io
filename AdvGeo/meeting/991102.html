<h3>
Term project as building a prototype of AdvGeo tutor</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Hooking up GRAMY to an ITS.</li>

<li>
Goal scaffolding by reification.</li>

<li>
Eliciting knowledge construction by meta cognitive prompting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Design issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To help students to construct auxiliary lines, by asking for an effective
DS.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>Meta cognitive prompting: [Polya57]
<p>"<i><b>Look at the conclusion.&nbsp; And try to think of a familiar
theorem having the same or a similar conclusion</b>."</i>
<br>"If two triangles are congruent, the corresponding angles are equal."
<br><i>"<b>Good!&nbsp; Now, here is a theorem related to yours and proved
before.&nbsp; Could you use it?</b>"</i>
<br>"I think so, but I do not see yet quite how."
<br><i>"<b>Should you introduce some auxiliary element in order to make
it use possible?</b>"</i>
<p>Reifying a DS application
<p><i>"<b>Could you see the auxiliary element?"</b></i>
<br>"....."
<br><i>"<b>Here you can overlap this known theorem against the figure like
this."</b></i>
<br>"Yah, I could draw a perpendicular to make a triangle congruent to
XYZ."</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
In general, to offer goal scaffolding as reifying a backward reasoning
with DS</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Highlight a goal.</li>

<li>
Ask any DS which matches against the figure and has a conclusion corresponding
to the goal.</li>

<li>
Graphically show how the DS overlaps against the figure, so that the students
can see "how it works."</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
And so for a forward reasoning with DS</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Technical goals of the project</h3>

<ul>
<li>
To implement a GUI that holds the properties described above.</li>

<li>
To implement an interface between GRAMY and the GUI to provide the above
functions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Examples of the hinting strategies by Polya</h3>

<ul>
<li>
What is the unknown?</li>

<li>
Could you derive something useful from the data?</li>

<li>
Do you know a related problem?</li>

<li>
Is it possible to satisfy the condition?</li>

<li>
Did you use all the data?</li>

<li>
Have you seen before?</li>
</ul>
