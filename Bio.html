<p>Dr. Noboru Matsuda is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University.  His research interests include applications of cutting-edge artificial intelligence technologies to enhance learning, as well as to advance cognitive theories in the sciences of learning. </p>
<p>Dr. Matsuda received an MS in Math Education from Tokyo Gakugei University (Tokyo, Japan) and a Ph.D in Intelligent Systems from the University of Pittsburgh under the supervision of Dr. Kurt VanLehn. Noboru has developed a number of intelligent tutoring systems primarily in STEM subjects including math (arithmetic, geometry theorem proving and algebra equations), C language, and the formal specification language Z.</p>
<p>Dr. Matsuda has been leading the SimStudent project (www.SimStudent.org) where the research team develops an artificial intelligence that can learn problem-solving skills through guided-problem solving (aka peer tutoring). He initially started the SimStudent project when he came to CMU in 2004 for his postdoctoral training. He has since expanded the project into multiple applications including intelligent authoring, teachable agent, and learning simulation. </p>
<p>In recent years, Dr. Matsuda has launched a new NSF funded project, the PASTEL project, where he and his research team develops evidence-based learning engineering methods to rapidly create adaptive online courseware (aka adaptive MOOC). The PASTEL method include, for example, an application of text mining method for automatic discovery of skills and concepts (aka a skill model) from written text (such as instruction paragraph and assessment items).  Another example of PASTEL method is an application of reinforcement learning for validating online courseware content based on students' learning activities and outcomes. </p>
<p>Dr. Matsuda loves programming and swimming when he is not dreaming of the future of education.</p>
