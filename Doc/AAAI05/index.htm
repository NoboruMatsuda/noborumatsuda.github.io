	<p><b>Abstract</b>: We are building an intelligent authoring tool for 
	Cognitive Tutors, a highly successful form of computer-based tutoring. The 
	primary target users (the authors) are educators who are not familiar with 
	cognitive task analysis and AI program-ming, which are essential tasks in 
	building Cognitive Tutors. Instead of asking authors to write a cognitive 
	model by hand, a Simulated Student embedded in the authoring tool lets an 
	author demonstrate how to perform the tasks in the subject domain, for 
	instance, solving an algebra equation. The Simulated Student observes an 
	author&#8217;s demonstration and induces a set of production rules that replicate 
	the demon-strated performances. Correct production rules, as well as 
	production rules that are incorrect but similar to those a human student 
	might produce, can be directly embedded in the Cognitive Tutor. We give a 
	preliminary evaluation of an implemented Simulated Students based on 
	inductive logic programming and path-finding.</p>
