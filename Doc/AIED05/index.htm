	<p><b>Abstract</b>: Two problem solving strategies, forward chaining and 
	backward chaining, were compared to see how they affect students&#8217; learning 
	of geometry theorem proving with construction. In order to determine which 
	strategy accelerates learning the most, an intelligent tutoring system, the 
	Advanced Geometry Tutor, was developed that can teach either strategy while 
	controlling all other instructional variable. 52 students were randomly 
	assigned to one of the two strategies. Although computational modeling 
	suggests an advantage for backwards chaining, especially on construction 
	problems, the result shows that (1) the students who learned forward 
	chaining showed better performance on proof-writing, especially on the 
	proofs with construction, than those who learned backward chaining, (2) both 
	forward and backward chaining conditions wrote wrong proofs equally 
	frequently, and (3) the major reason for the difficulty in applying backward 
	chaining appears to lie in the assertion of premises as unjustified 
	propositions (i.e., subgoaling). </p>
