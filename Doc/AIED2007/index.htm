	<p><b>Abstract</b>: SimStudent is a machine-learning agent that learns 
	cognitive skills by demonstration. SimStudent was originally built as a 
	building block for Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools to help an author build a 
	cognitive model without heavy programming. In this paper, we evaluate a 
	second use of SimStudent for student modeling for Intelligent Tutoring 
	Systems. The basic idea is to have SimStudent observe human students solving 
	problems with an intelligent tutoring system. It then induces a cognitive 
	model that replicates their performance on these problems. If the model is 
	accurate, it predicts the human students' performance on novel problems. An 
	evaluation study with log data from genuine student-tutor interactions 
	showed that when trained on 15 problems, SimStudent accurately predicted the 
	human students' correct behavior more than 80% of the time (i.e., it can 
	tell when the human students make correct steps). However, the current 
	implementation of SimStudent does not accurately predict when the human 
	students make errors. This paper gives a detailed description of the 
	evaluation study and discusses the lessons learned.</p>
