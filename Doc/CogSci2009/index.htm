	A Computational Model of How Learner Errors Arise from Weak Prior Knowledge. 
	In Conference of the Cognitive Science Society.</p>
	<p>How do differences in prior conceptual knowledge affect the nature and 
	rate of learning? To answer this question, we built a computational model of 
	learning, called SimStudent, and conducted a controlled simulation study to 
	investigate how learning a complex skill changes when the system is given 
	&quot;weak&quot; domain-general vs. &quot;strong&quot; domain-specific prior knowledge. We 
	measured learning outcomes with the rate of learning, the accuracy of 
	learned skills (test scores), and the accuracy in predicting patterns of 
	real student errors. We found not only that the accuracy of learned skills 
	decreases when weak prior knowledge is given, but also the learning rate 
	significantly slows down. The accuracy of predicting student errors also 
	increased significantly, and SimStudent with the weak prior knowledge made 
	the same errors that real students commonly make. These modeling results 
	help explain empirical results connecting prior knowledge and student 
	learning (Booth &amp; Koedinger, 2008). </p>
