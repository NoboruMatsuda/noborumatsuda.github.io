<blockquote>
  <table border="0" id="table1">
	<tr>
		<td align="justify"><font color="#000080">Two problem solving strategies, forward chaining and backward chaining, 
  were compared to see how they affect students&#8217; learning of geometry theorem 
  proving with construction. It has been claimed that backward chaining is 
  inappropriate for novice students due to its complexity. On the other hand, 
  forward chaining may not be appropriate either for this particular task 
  because it can explode combinatorially. </font>
  <p><font color="#000080">In order to determine which strategy accelerates learning the most, an 
  intelligent tutoring system was developed. It is unique in two ways: (1) It 
  has a fine grained cognitive model of proof-writing, which captured both 
  observable and unobservable inference steps. This allows the tutor to provide 
  elaborate scaffolding. (2) Depending on the student&#8217;s competence, the tutor 
  provides a variety of scaffolding from showing precise steps to just prompting 
  students for a next step. In other words, the students could learn 
  proof-writing through both worked-out examples (by observing a model of 
  proof-writing generated by the tutor) and problem solving (by writing proofs 
  by themselves). </font> </p>
  <p><font color="#000080">52 students were randomly assigned to one of the tutoring systems. They 
  solved 11 geometry proof problems with and without construction with the aid 
  from the intelligent tutor. The results show that (1) the students who learned 
  forward chaining showed better performance on proof-writing than those who 
  learned backward chaining, (2) both forward and backward chaining conditions 
  wrote wrong proofs equally frequently, (3) both forward and backward chaining 
  conditions seldom wrote redundant or wrong statements when they wrote correct 
  proofs, (4) the major reason for the difficulty in applying backward chaining 
  lay in the assertion of premises as unjustified propositions (i.e., subgoaling). 
  These results provide theoretical implications for the design of tutoring 
  systems for problem solving. </font> </p></td>
