<P>&nbsp;<P><B>Abstract:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This study is intended to investigate a method to diagnose
the student model in the domain of procedural problem solving. In this
domain, the goal of an instruction should be to understand the processes
of solving given problems, and to understand the reasons why problems can
be solved by using certain knowledge; the acquisition of problem solving
skills might not be the intrinsic instructional goals.
<P>The tutoring systems in this domain must understand the effect of each
problem solving operators, as well as when to implement these operators
in order to effectively solve given problems. We have been studying and
developing a system which deals with student modelling in the domain of
procedural problem solving. We believe that the two types of knowledge
should be clearly defined for the diagnosing tasks; <I>effective knowledge</I>
(EK) and <I>principle knowledge</I> (PK). The former is the knowledge that
is explicitly applied by students throughout problem solving processes,
and the latter is the one that gives the justifications of the EK.
<P>We have developed a student model diagnosing system that infers students'
knowledge structure pertaining to PK, based on the  student model about EK. This 
student model diagnosing method requires knowledge which argues the relationship 
between PK and EK. This knowledge
plays the very important role in our system, and it is hard to describe
such knowledge properly by hand.
<P>In this paper, we provide a student model diagnosing system which has
the knowledge acquiring function to learn the relationship between EK and
PK. The system acquires this knowledge through its own problem solving
experience. Based on the student model and the acquired relational knowledge,
the system can give students proper instructions about construction of
EK with explanations in terms of PK. The system has been partly implemented
with CESP language on a UNIX workstation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
