	<p><b>Abstract</b>: The aim of this study is to incorporate the technique of 
	programming by demonstration (PBD) into an authoring tool for Cognitive 
	Tutors. The primary motivation of using PBD is to facilitate the authoring 
	of Cognitive Tutors by educators, rather than AI programmers. That is, 
	instead of asking authors to build a cognitive model representing a task to 
	be taught, a machine-learning agent &#8211; called the Simulated Student &#8211; 
	observes the author performing the target task and induces production rules 
	that replicate the author&#8217;s performance. FOIL is used to learn conditions 
	appearing in the production rules. An evaluation in an example domain of 
	algebra equation solving shows that observing 10 problems solved in 44 
	steps induced 9 correct and 1 wrong production rules. Two of the correctly 
	induced rules were overly general hence produced redundant solutions. </p>
