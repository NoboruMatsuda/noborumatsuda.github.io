	<p><b>Abstract</b>: Is learning by solving problems better than learning 
	from worked-out examples? Using a machine-learning program that learns 
	cognitive skills from examples or by being taught, we have conducted a study 
	to compare three learning strategies: learning by solving problems with 
	feedback and hints from a tutor, learning by generalizing worked-out 
	examples exhaustively, and learning by generalizing worked-out examples only 
	for the skills that need to be generalized. The results showed that learning 
	by tutored problem solving outperformed other learning strategies on the 
	test scores that were measured on each problem solving step as the average 
	ratio of the correct to incorrect rule applications. The advantage of 
	tutored problem solving was mostly due to the error detection and correction 
	that was available only when skills were applied incorrectly. The current 
	study also suggested that learning certain kinds of conditions to apply 
	rules only for appropriate situations is quite difficult. That is, learning 
	how to perform mathematically valid operations is easier than learning <i>
	when</i> to apply rules. </p>
