<blockquote>
	<p>The purpose of the current study was to test whether we could create a 
	system where students can learn by teaching a live machine-learning agent. 
	SimStudent is a computer agent that interactively learns cognitive skills 
	through its own tutored-problem solving experience. We have developed a 
	game-like learning environment where students learn algebra equations by 
	tutoring SimStudent. While Simulated Students, Teachable Agents and Learning 
	Companion systems have been created, our study is unique that it genuinely 
	learns skills from student input. This paper describes the overview of the 
	learning environment and some results from an evaluation study. The study 
	showed that after tutoring SimStudent, the students improved their 
	performance on equation solving. The number of correct answers on the error 
	detection items was also significantly improved. On average students spent 
	70.0 minutes on tutoring SimStudent and used an average of 15 problems for 
	tutoring.</p>
