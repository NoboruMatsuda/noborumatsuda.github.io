Abstract:</h3>

<blockquote>
  The statement that "<i>Mathematics education in secondary school
might make students familiar with the deductive method</i>" surely makes
sense and is fairly accepted by many mathematics teachers.&nbsp; On the
other hand, there exist some mathematics educators who are skeptical about
this practical postulation.&nbsp; Van Hiele argued that the educational
value of geometry is not only found in the deductive method, and proposed
the developmental levels of geometric thinking to argue that "the development
of logical thinking must be considered as the result of a learning process."&nbsp;
He emphasized that students' deductive thinking ability in geometry ought
to be based on their naive spatial concept.&nbsp; In this proposal, we
discuss a cognitive contribution of the diagrammatic reasoning model for
an geometry ITS.&nbsp; The model is organized with the structural knowledge
(called diagrammatic schema; DS, for short) which represents diagrammatic
information as well as the logical implications among geometric relations.
