  <p align="justify"><font color="#000080"><b>Abstract</b></font>: The purpose 
  of this study is to investigate a computational model for Euclidean geometry 
  theorem proving with construction. &#8220;Construction&#8221; means drawing additional 
  geometric elements in the problem figure. Some geometry theorems require 
  construction as a part of the proof. The basic idea of our construction 
  procedure is to add only elements required for applying a postulate that has a 
  consequence that unifies with a goal to be proven. In other words, a 
  construction is made only if it supports backward application of a postulate. 
  Our major finding is that our proof procedure is semi-complete and useful in 
  practice. In particular, an empirical evaluation showed that our theorem 
  prover, GRAMY, solves all 17 construction problems from school textbooks as 
  well as 86% (18 out of 21) of the construction problems solved by the 
  preceding studies on automated geometry theorem proving. Three problems that 
  GRAMY failed to solve require multiple constructions, and were solved by 
  ad-hoc heuristics in the previous work. </p>
