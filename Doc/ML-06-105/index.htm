	<p><font size="2"><b>Abstract</b>: The aim of this study is to build an 
	intelligent authoring environment for Cognitive Tutors in which the author 
	need not manually write a cognitive model. Writing a cognitive model usually 
	requires days of programming and testing even for a well-trained cognitive 
	scientist. To achieve our goal, we have built a machine learning agent &#8211; 
	called a Simulated Student &#8211; that automatically generates a cognitive model 
	from sample solutions demonstrated by the human domain expert (i.e., the 
	author). This paper studies the effectiveness and generality of the 
	Simulated Student. The major findings include (1) that the order of training 
	problems does not affect a quality of the cognitive model at the end of the 
	training session, (2) that ambiguities in the interpretation of 
	demonstrations might hinder machine learning, and (3) that more detailed 
	demonstration can both avoid difficulties with ambiguity and prevent search 
	complexity from growing to impractical levels.</font></p>
