	<p><font size="2"><b>Abstract</b>: A simulated student is a machine learning 
	agent that learns a set of cognitive skills by observing solutions demon-strated 
	by human experts. The learned cognitive skills are converted into a 
	cognitive model for a Cognitive Tutor that is a computerized tutor that 
	teaches human students the cognitive skills. In this paper, we analyze the 
	characteristics of the effective demonstrations that lead to quicker and 
	more accurate learning. Results from empirical studies show that expressive 
	demonstrations (as opposed to abbreviated demonstrations that involve 
	implicit mental operations) are better for both speed and accuracy of 
	learning. We also found that providing multiple demonstrations of the same 
	cognitive skill with differing surface features accelerates learning. These 
	findings imply that the ordering of training sequence as well as the level 
	of detail in demonstration determines the efficiency with which a simulated 
	student generates a cognitive model.</font></p>
