      <td width="100%">Geometry theorem proving is a challenging task,
        especially when it involves construction – namely, to add new segments
        and points to a problem figure to complete a proof.&nbsp; Little is
        known about expert performance on construction.&nbsp; There exists a
        model of theorem proving with construction as a state-space search, but
        appears to be computationally beyond the human reasoning capacity.&nbsp;
        It is also known that for geometry theorem proving, the ratio of the
        number of irrelevant paths to the number of solution paths is very high.&nbsp;
        Hence, it might be more efficient to use heuristics to select only
        appropriate paths instead of rejecting inappropriate ones.&nbsp;
        However, our experiment showed that an experienced subject in theorem
        proving preferred to use rejection heuristics.&nbsp; This paper examines
        search heuristics that human provers can use to explain this unexpected
        observation.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to build a cognitive model of
        theorem proving with construction for a computerized tutoring system
        that can help students to construct such proofs by themselves.&nbsp; In
        this paper, we also discuss several factors that make constructions so
        difficult.&nbsp;</td>
