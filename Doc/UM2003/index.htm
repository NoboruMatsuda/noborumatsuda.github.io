  <p><b>Abstract</b>:&nbsp; This study characterizes hinting strategies used by 
  a human tutor to help students learn geometry theorem proving. Current 
  tutoring systems for theorem proving provide hints that encourage (or force) 
  the student to follow a fixed forward and/or backward chaining strategy. In 
  order to find out if human tutors observed a similar constraint, a study was 
  conducted with students proving geometry theorems individually with a human 
  tutor. When working successfully (without hints), students did not 
  consistently follow the forward and/or backward chaining strategy. Moreover, 
  the human tutor hinted steps that were seldom ones that would be picked by 
  such tutoring systems. Lastly, we discovered a simple categorization of hints 
  that covered 97% of the hints given by the human tutor. </p>
