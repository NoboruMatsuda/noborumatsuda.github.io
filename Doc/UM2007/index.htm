	<p><b>Abstract</b>: The Simulated Students are machine-learning agents that 
	learn cognitive skills by demonstration. They were originally developed as a 
	building block for the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) so that the 
	authors do not have to build a cognitive model by hand, but instead simply 
	demonstrate solutions for the Simulated Students to automatically generate a 
	cognitive model. The Simulated-Student technology could then be used to 
	model human students' performance as well. To evaluate applicability of the 
	Simulated Students as a tool for modeling real students, we applied the 
	Simulated Students to a genuine learning log gathered from classroom 
	instructions using the Algebra I Cognitive Tutor. Such data can be seen as 
	the human students' &quot;demonstrations&quot; on how to solve problems. The results 
	from the empirical study show that the Simulated Students can indeed model 
	human students' performances. After training on 20 problems solved by a set 
	of human students, a cognitive model generated by Simulated Students 
	explained 82% of the problem-solving steps performed correctly by another 
	set of human students.</p>
