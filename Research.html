<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>I am an associate professor of computer science and a director of the <a href="https://www.ieclab.org" target="new">Innovative Educational Computing Laboratory</a> at the <a href="https://www.csc.ncsu.edu">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu">North Carolina State University</a>. I am also an affiliate of the <a href="https://www.cei.ncsu.edu" target="new">Center for Educational Informatics</a> and a member of the <a href="https://facultyclusters.ncsu.edu/people/nmatsud" target="new">Digital Transformation of Education</a> cluster at the NCSU Chancellor's Faculty Excellence Program. </p>
<p>My primary research focus is on the  technology innovation and integration to  advance the sciences of computing and human/machine learning.</p>
<p>To make a breakthrough innovation, I value mathematics principles behind the machine learning technologies and AI in general. I am interested in understanding the underlying computation to realize desired technologies to improve the future of education. On that account, I am an AI tech-engineer to build transformative educational technologies.</p>
<p>I am interested in innovating cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for students to learn, teachers to teach, and researchers to understand how people learn (and, more importantly, fail to learn!). I study the transformative theory of learning and teaching to understand how people learn and how people should be taught. I am therefore a computer scientist acting as a learning scientist working on the empirical data collected from field studies conducted with the learning technologies that I invent. I also recognize myself as a lifelong practitioner to improve education.</p>
<p>My scholarly expertise thus spans education, learning science, cognitive science, and computer science. <a href="CV/Research Statement 2021-07-27 V2.pdf" target="_blank">Follow this link for an extended research statement (PDF)</a></p>

    <td>SimStudent is a computational model of learning cognitive skills from examples. It is a model of inductive rule learning through tutored-problem solving. Using the SimStudent technology, we study domain-general and domain-specific mechanisms of skill acquisition, which in turn provides us insights into theories of machine- and human-learning. Applications of SimStudent include intelligent authoring (to facilitate authoring of cognitive tutors), teachable agent (to advance the theory of learning by teaching), and learning simulation (to understand how students learn). </td>

    <td>How to teach geometry theorem proving with construction?  The &quot;construction&quot; here is to add segments into a problem figure using compasses and a straightedge <em>as part of a proof</em>.  Two major findings from this project include: (1) Construction can be done algorithmically (c.f., heuristic knowledge for construction a la Polya). (2) Students who were taught proofs with construction as a forward chaining procedure showed better proof-writing performance than those who were taught the backward chaining procedure.</td>
