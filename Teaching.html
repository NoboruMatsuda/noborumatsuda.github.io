<p>I have two forms of  contribution to teaching: Mentoring and Course Instructions</p>
<h2>Mentoring</h2>
<p>I am always interested in working with motivated students at any level, at any time. Anything of your interest that is related to any of my projects (which ensures that I can be of your help) would be fine. If you are interested, send me your CV along with a brief project proposal (i.e., something that tells me what you are interested). I would highly recommend you to read project descriptions and related papers to find the best fit. I would highly recommend you to read <a href="Research.html">project descriptions</a> and <a href="Publications.html">related papers</a> to find the best fit. </p>
